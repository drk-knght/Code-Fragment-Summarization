# Code-Fragment-Summarization


•	Study Project on Code Fragment Summarization

# Dataset

•	The dataset of [Source Code Fragment Summarization with Crowdsourcing Based Features](http://oscar-lab.org/CFS/) was used for our training. We have trained on Google Colaboratory. 

# Results

•	Our model did not match with the statistical values as mentioned in the paper. However the values produced by our model is closer to the one claimed in the research paper. 


•	The primary reason for the mismatch of recall, accuracy and precision is due to unavailability of the data points under all headers. In the [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11704-015-4409-2) they presented out 21 features along with their names and range, but according to the above mentioned link only 19 features were present in the dataset.
